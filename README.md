# Pixel Showdown

The project Pixel Showdown has been started as a worshop in C++ courses, endorsed by Alan MÃ©ziane Dahmam at ALGOSUP.<br>
However, this is the Unity-based version, used to go further on the project. We now use C#.<br><br>
This game is 2D versus-fighting game. 2 players can play (1v1) with Xbox Controllers.
Each player has 3 lives, and if your opponent doesn't have any lives left, you win!<br>
